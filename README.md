# DGI Spreadsheet UI Helper

## Introduction
This module looks to add some ease of use UI functionality to the Islandora Spreadsheet Ingest module.

## Usage
#### CSV template generation
Found at `admin/content/islandora_spreadsheet_ingest/generate_template`, this functionality presents a form to allow users to select the fields they want to include in a given spreadsheet migration.

Here you can provide a template name via the _CSV name_ text field. This will be used for naming the CSV file.

Checking the "Include examples?" checkbox will include sample data in the CSV. This is useful for data formatting.
Checking the "Display descriptions?" checkbox, will render descriptions of each header option.
